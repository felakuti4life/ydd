Game Concept:
     The game concept is a cross between yahtzee and Dungeons
     and Dragons. Essentially, the user rolls a dice to decide
     his fate against one of many monsters, including a dragon.

     Based on what the user roles, he or she will either attack
     the monster or be attacked. In the event that both the user
     and the computer roll the same values, neither the monster
     nor the user attacks.
